# PropertyCore FAQ
Frequently asked questions about PropertyCore

## Who are you?
Well, if you were referred to this help site from PropertyCore, then we work for the same organization that you do. I try to avoid specifically naming myself or our organization because this help site is deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which means that, unlike PropertyCore itself, this help site is available on the public internet. We've used Github Pages to host this site because it is much easier to update the site content on a GitHub Page than on a page hosted within PropertyCore. 

## What is PropertyCore?
PropertyCore is the result of an idea that came from our frustration with the lack of tools for quickly and effectively managing property items in the records management system. We thought that we could build a better interface using the web and, hopefully, make many of the common property management tasks a little easier. 

## Is PropertyCore secure?
PropertyCore uses [Windows Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/windows-authentication/windows-authentication-overview) to authenticate users and restricts access to the application to only users with current, valid Windows credentials. When you log on to PropertyCore, you may be prompted to provide your Windows username and password, but you are providing this information *to Windows itself,* not PropertyCore. Windows simply validates your credentials and tells PropertyCore if you are who you say you are. Neither PropertyCore nor the PropertyCore adminstrator will ever see, have access to, or ask you for your password. You should *never* share your password with *any* person, including any person who is or claims to be part of PropertyCore or your organization's IT department. Additionally, PropertyCore runs on the organization's intranet, which is separated from the public internet. The downside is that you cannot access PropertyCore from outside the organization's network (unless you have VPN access), but the upside is that the information contained in PropertyCore is better protected.

## Do I need a PropertyCore account?
It depends. Certain tools in PropertyCore are secured behind administrative credentials that we issue to verified users. [Contact us](mailto:Police_JAIC@co.pg.md.us?subject=PropertyCore-Access) if you think you need access.

## Whats in it for you? 
It will sound strange to most people, but we don't do this for money. We don't get paid to build these tools. We really enjoy programming and see endless opportunities to apply our limited skills to projects that, hopefully, make your job a little easier. It is rewarding to build something and see people actually use it in the field without prompting or pressure from higher up, because it means that we've built something *helpful.* There is no higher compliment.
